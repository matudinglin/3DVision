# Assignment 1 Overview

Here is the checklist for the assignment:

- [x] Loop subdivision.
- [x] Implement Quadratic Error based mesh decimation.
- [x] Write up your project, details of data structure, algorithms, reporting runtime, and visualizations of results with different parameters.
- [x] Extra credit: Analyze corner cases (failure cases) and find solutions to prevent them.
- [x] Extra credit: Implement Loop subdivision using two different data structures.
- [x] Extra credit: Preserve the original vertices after decimation.

**Note:** I use the OpenMesh library for the halfedge data structure. Please install OpenMesh before running the code. Please note that the OpenMesh library only supports Python version no later than 3.9.

# Assignment 2 Overview

Here is the checklist for the assignment:

- [x] Implement the structure-from-motion algorithm with the start code.
- [x] Write up your project, algorithms, reporting results (reprojection error) and visualisations (point cloud and camera pose), compare your reconstruction with open source software Colmap.
- [x] Extra credit: Experiment with outlier filtering techniques.
