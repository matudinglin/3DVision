		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Here is the checklist for the assignment:
			<ul>
				<li>Complete the training using your own data. &#10004 </li>
				<li>Write up your project, algorithms, reporting results and visualisations, compare your reconstruction with open source software Colmap. &#10004</li>
				<li>Extra credit: Present results with your own captured data. &#10004</li>
				<li>Extra credit: Train your models with both Nerf and 3DGS. &#10004</li>
			</ul>
			
			There are more results could be found in folder: assets/assignment3.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Algorithm and Implementation</h2>
		<h3>NeRF</h3>
		<p>
			The implementation I used could be found in the following link: <a href="https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio">NeRF</a> <br><br>
			
			I used the following steps to train the model with my own data:
			<ul>
				<li>Use FFmpeg and Colmap to preprocess and doing SfM from the captured video.</li>
				<li>Inputs multiple 2D images of a scene with known camera positions.</li>
				<li>Train the model mapping 3D coordinates and viewing directions to color and density.</li>
				<li>Optimizes the neural network by minimizing the difference between rendered and actual images.</li>
				<li>Uses differentiable volume rendering to simulate light accumulation and render images from any viewpoint.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>3DGS</h3>
		<p>
			The implementation I used could be found in the following link: <a href="https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting">3DGS</a> <br><br>

			I used the following steps to train the model with my own data:
			<ul>
				<li>Use FFmpeg and Colmap to preprocess and doing SfM from the captured video.</li>
				<li>Generates a set of 3D Gaussians from the SfM points, providing a smooth representation.</li>
				<li>Optimizes and adaptively adjusts the density of the 3D Gaussians to capture the scene accurately.</li>
				<li>After training, use fast differentiable rasterizer for rendering Gaussians.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Results and Comparsion</h2>
		<p>
			I compare the result between 3DGS, NeRF and Colmap with my own captured scene. I used a 15 seconds videos the input data for the training. 
			<br><br>
			Here is the input video:
			<br>
			<video width="640" height="480" controls>
				<source src="../assets/assignment3/input_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			</video>

			<h3>Colmap</h3>
			Here is the result of the Colmap:
			<br>
			<video width="640" height="400" controls>
				<source src="../assets/assignment3/colmap/colmap.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			</video>

			
			<h3>NeRF</h3>
			Here is the result of the NeRF:
			<br>
			<video width="640" height="400" controls>
				<source src="../assets/assignment3/nerf/nerf.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			</video>

			<h3>3DGS</h3>
			Here is the result of the 3DGS:
			<br>
			<video width="640" height="480" controls>
				<source src="../assets/assignment3/3dgs/3dgs.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			</video>

			<h3>Comparsion</h3>
			<p>
				From the results, we can observe that NeRF, 3DGS, and COLMAP all produce satisfactory results:
				<ul>
					<li>3DGS offers smoother surfaces compared to NeRF and COLMAP and renders faster than NeRF. 3D Gaussian Splatting is noted for its rendering speed and proves to be the fastest method. However, it sacrifices the precision of finer details.</li>
					<li>NeRF delivers realistic and detailed outputs, but its initial results often contain significant background noise due to initialization with random noise. It requires substantial computational resources and extensive training and rendering time.</li>
					<li>COLMAP produces the accurate and detailed reconstructions, but it cannot handle complex lighting and occlusion.</li>
				</ul>

			This point cloud is cutout from the original point cloud because the original point cloud contains noise background.
