        I use <b>openmesh</b> library for halfedge data structure. Please install <a href="url">openmesh</a> before running the code.
        Please note that openmesh library only supports python verison no later than <b>3.9</b>.

    <h2>Data structure and Algorithm</h2>
    <h3> Loop Subdivision</h3>
    <p>
        I used both halfedge data structure and array data structure to implement loop subdivision. 
        <br><br>
        In summary, halfedge data structure is more efficient in terms of memory and time complexity. However, it is more complex to implement and debug. On the other hand, array data structure is not easy to understand in terms of mesh operations.
        <br><br>
        For the boundary case, I used a mask array to store the boundary vertices and edges in array data implementation. In halfedge data implementation, I used a flag to indicate whether the edge is on the boundary.
        <br><br>
        Here is the pseudo code I used for loop subdivision, more details could be found in comments of the code:
        <ul>
            <li>Calculate new positions for existing vertices </li>
            <li>Split every edge and create new vertices at midpoints</li>
            <li>Reconnect vertices to form new faces  </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3> Mesh Simplification</h3>
    <p>
        I used halfedge data structure to implement quadric error based mesh simplification.
        <br><br>
        I compute the quadric for each vertex and cost for each edge in the halfedge data structure, and store them as attributes of the vertices and edges. I tried both min heap implementation and linear search implementation to find the edge whose collapse minimizes the total quadric error. The min heap implementation is more efficient in terms of time complexity. However, in practice, due to the garbage collection in openmesh library, the min heap implementation is not as efficient as the linear search implementation. So I used the linear search implementation in the final version.
        <br><br>
        To get the subset decimation, I remain the original vertices position after edge collapse, and update the quadric for the related vertices and edges.
        <br><br>
        Here is the pseudo code I used for mesh simplification, more details could be found in comments of the code:
        <ul>
            <li>Compute quadric for each vertex</li>
            <li>Compute edge cost for each valid pair</li>
            <li>Collapse edges until the target face count is reached</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Find the edge whose collapse minimizes the total quadric error</li>
                    <li>Update quadrics for related the vertices and edges</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
