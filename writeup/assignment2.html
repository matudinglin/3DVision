		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Here is the checklist for the assignment:
			<ul>
				<li>Implement the structure-from-motion algorithm with the start code. &#10004 </li>
				<li>Write up your project, algorithms, reporting results (reprojection error) and visualisations (point cloud and camera pose), compare your reconstruction with open source software Colmap. &#10004</li>
				<li>Extra credit: Present results with your own captured data. &#10004</li>
				<li>Extra credit: Experiment with outlier filtering techniques. &#10004</li>
			</ul>
			
			There are more results could be found in folder: assets/assignment2.

		<h2>Algorithm and Implementation</h2>
		<h3>Structure from Motion</h3>
		<p>
			Here is the pseudo code I used for SFM algorithm, more details could be found in comments of the code:
			<ul>
				<li>Select the first two images for initial pose estimation and triangulation.</li>
				<li>Perform baseline triangulation for the first two images.</li>
				<li>Generate a 3D point cloud and evaluate reprojection error for the initial pair of images.</li>
				<li>For each remaining image: 
					<ul>
						<li>Estimate the new camera pose.</li>
						<li>Triangulate points from the new view.</li>
						<li>Update the 3D point cloud and compute reprojection error for the new camera.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Compute Reprojection Error</h3>
		<p>
			To compute the reprojection error, I used the following steps:
			<ul>
				<li>Extract image data, load features, and filter out invalid 3D point references.</li>
				<li>Compute 3D points from valid references and project these points onto the image.</li>
				<li>Calculate the errors between the original 2D points and the projected 2D points, and filter out outlier errors.</li>
				<li>Calculate average reprojection error.</li>
				<li>Plot the final result.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Triangulate New View</h3>
		<p>
			I tried many different outlier filtering techniques, including RANSAC, dynamical range thresholding, and reprojection error filtering. I found that the best results were achieved by using a combination of reprojection error filtering and depth filtering.
			<br><br>
			For each new view, I used the following steps to triangulate the points:
			<ul>
				<li>Iterates through all previous views to find feature matches with the new view.</li>
				<li>Filters matches to include only those not already associated with a point in the point cloud.</li>
				<li>For each pair of views with valid matches:
					<ul>
						<li>Aligns the matched features and extracts corresponding 2D points from both images.</li>
						<li>Performs triangulation to generate new 3D points between the two views.</li>
						<li>Filters newly triangulated points based on reprojection error and position within dynamically defined ranges.</li>
						<li>Updates the global point cloud and reference indices for the new view with valid points.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
